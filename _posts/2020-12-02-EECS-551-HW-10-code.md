"""
p, q = poly_coeff(a, b, c, d)
Use Kronecker products to construct integer−valued polynomials
with the given (algebraic) numbers as zeros.
In:
* `a, b, c, d` are positive integers
Out:
* `p` and `q` are vectors of length 5 with `p[1] = 1` and `q[1] = 1`
such that, in the notation defined below, `P3(x3) = 0` and `P4(x4) = 0`
Notation:
* `x1 = a + sqrt(b)`
* `x2 = c − sqrt(d)`
* `x3 = x1 + x2`
* `x4 = x1 * x2`
* `P1(x)` a quadratic monic polynomial with integer−valued coefficients with a zero at `x1`
* `P2(x)` a quadratic monic polynomial with integer−valued coefficients with a zero at `x2`
* `P3(x) = x^4 + p[2] x^3 + p[3] x^2 + p[4] x + p[5]`
* `P4(x) = x^4 + q[2] x^3 + q[3] x^2 + q[4] x + q[5]`
